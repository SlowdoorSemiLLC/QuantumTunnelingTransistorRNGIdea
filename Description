Albert Einstein once said that information cannot travel faster than light.
When transistors shrink, they may exhibit current leakage, where some
electrons begin to quantum tunnel through the transistor gate. Because
an electron quantum tunneling through a transistor gate is the electron
essentially teleporting through a transistor gate, that means it travels
faster than the speed of light. And because it travels faster than the
speed of light, that means that the electron carries no information,
meaning that the probability of it tunneling or not tunneling is
actually random according to the laws of physics. This means that all
other so-called "random number generators" are lies. They are all
pseudo-random number generators.

If a transistor were to be designed specifically for electrons to
quantum tunnel every clock cycle with an exact 50% probability of
occurrence and the output of that transistor ANDed with a clock
signal wire, then a quantum tunneling transistor random number
generator would be constructed. It would also provide a bitrate
equal to the clock frequency.

I would add 256 of these transistors to my FPGA, and spread them
out in a 16 by 16 grid across the chip.
